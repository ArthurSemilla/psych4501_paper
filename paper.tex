\abstract{This paper will explore the applications of Abnormal Psychology in the film \textit{Apocalypse Now}, including correct and incorrect aspects of symptoms, diagnosis, and other disorders that are depicted in the movie. Using the DSM-V as the source for determining the accuracy of disorders, the characters in the film, primarily Captain Benjamin L. Willard and Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, will be thoroughly examined to outline which disorder, or disorders, they exhibit and which the film may inaccurately depict. Because the film is based in the Vietnam War, the perspective when analyzing the characters will be shifted to fit the setting, thus potentially causing a diagnosis to be different than the diagnosis of a “normal” life experience.}
